¹⁰⁸ PLATES VII. Aru> VIII. ,

Tarsa two platos should be examined together, as both show similar portions of the
nave to a larger scale. The detail is very curious, and the general design full 01
Interest The work of the original Abbey is represented by portions of the splayed
base, the plinth, and the south club skew of the west gable. On Plate VII, parts of
the splayed base are shown, stopped against the later buttresses on either side 01 the
entrance door. The detail of these two portione of the base is different (Plate XXV„
Nos9 and 10), and another similar base from the southwell of the nave is shown 011
Ρ1010 v111.,and is detailed 011 Plate XXV, No. 11. The wall plinth 10 0100 detailed
aa No.5 on the same plate, while the general form of the olub skew on the west
gable is shown on Plate VIII. It will be noted that the buttress on the right 01 the
entrance door 10 1111111 upon the foundations of an earlier 1111111000, the lower splay
of which yet remains; and that the wall plinth hasbeen stoppad against the top
stone of this high 1111111000, but this top stone 1100 now disappeared. The entrance
door is a remarkable piece of design The moulded jambs (Plate XXV„ No. 1) are
without either caps 01 bases, and a moulded string (Plate XXV, N o. 3) forms a general
abacus, against the under side of which the projecting members of these jambs are
finished3 the upper portione, or 1100110, being, however, first cut inwards to suit the
curvatura of the abacus. The detail of the arch mould and the upper line of the abacus
are shown on Plate XXV, No. 13 while the detail of the inner arris of the door is
figured No. 2 on the same Plate. The only 110011 mould found in this portion of the
nave is that of the little 1110110111 the wall above this door, and it is detailcd on Plate
XXV, Noa The door platform follows the general slope of the nave floor, thus
making the door jambs of unaqual height, as figured. A stone step seems to have
been fitted in across the door, and the ends 01 this step have been returned to suit the
moulded jambs In the interior 11110 door appears to have undergone considerable
repsit, and very little of the original masonry remeius, the eight moulded stones
representing the only existing portions. On its right is the shallow hollow, indicating
the position of the holy water basin

The nave windows are also very curicus, their moulded rybats (Plate XXV, N 0. 6)
0001013103 inward towards the top, somewhat after the manner of 0 Greek doorway ;
and the 1101100111 at 1110 springiug of the window arch continues across itself, but with
aslightly fiatter detail, the corresponding members 01 the rybats. A section taken
through this window is shown on Plate VIII, and it also gives 0 side view of 0110 01
the ordinary buttresses 01 the nave, with the wall plinth (Plate XXV, No. 8) 01 the
same period above. Lady Row died in 1530, and the little window above her tomb

is 01 about this date; and, although thirteenth century 111 10011113, there is no doubt
whatever as to its late insertion, the outer order 01 0110 01 the nave windows being still
in position round it, while the space below the sill hos been built up and formed the
back of the tomb. It is probably a copy or rendering 01 011 earlier window, and its
curved transom is certainly unique in the history of architectura. A detail 01 the
rybat and mullion of this window is 311011 011 Ρ1010 XXV, N 0. 7.
