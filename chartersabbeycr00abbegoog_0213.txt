PLATE XXI.

Tms is the only measured drawing illustrative of the Abbot’s tower, and on is is
shown a plan and elevation of one side of its prinoipal aparhment. The flat jointing
of she round corner stones of the fireplace opening is very bad, and the lintel, whjoh
the left hand stone shows to have been keyed in, is now lost. The raised stone fender
is, however, a good feature, and one to be commended in those early days when floor
thoughts were common and carpetas somewhat roreluxnry. At the side of the fira-
plaee is a small aumbry, of a curione and rather awkward shape; is shows a gibbles
oheek, and the hinge end fastening marks of a small door. Along the top of the wall
above is a continuous oorbel ming, for the suppono of the oeiling beams. A seotion

and half plan of the window in the west wall is shown, and in the opposite wall a
large moulded aumbry. The detail of this aumb1yjamb and those of the entrance
door and fireplaee ore shown on Plato XXV11.,N0s. 21, 19, and 20.
