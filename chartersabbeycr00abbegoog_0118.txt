1011111111 are the ordinary stone benches. This chamber is second in importunae
only to the ehuroh itself. Here all the business of the Abbey was transacted,1ules
were read, publio confession 01 faults made, judgment given, and penanee ordained.
Adjoining tha chapter-houseis the parlour, where a monk could hold private inter-
eourse with a friend, or trade with 1 merchant. Its 1001 hasbeen semicircularin form,
and one stone of the moulded door jamb, its splayed step, and the sill 01 the narrow
ehamfered window, 110 101 in position. Beyond 11111 parlour is the vaulted slype, one
01 the most distinctiva features 01 the east olley. It formed the passage to the monhs'
eemetery, and through it the funeral passed after dirge or devotion hed been said 01
sung in the chapter-house At Orosraguel it was also the passage 10 the infirmary
garth, andita stone benches formed 1 quiet and shaded seat from the heat 01 the
summer sun. 'fhe last ehamber on the east side 01 the garth was probably used as a
dungeon 01 penitential cell 101 the confinement 01 minor offenders. It is usually
situated near the chapter-house, sometimes direetly adjoining. This cell is, however,
quite distinct from the prison for the incarceration of grave offenders. It was under
the charge 011110 infirmarer, and is here entered from a 01011 passage between the
infirmary garth and the cellarer’s passage. The refectory was invariably placed on

the south side of the eloister, and in Benedictine and Cluniae monasteries was built
east and west, or parallel with the axis of the ohuroh. At Orosraguel the buttery 11 11
its west eud, communicating across 1 passage with the kitohen and scullery. These
buildings on the south welk of the eloister are among the 111011 additions 10 the Abbey

The refectory had the usual barrelwaulted 1001, 1111 light was admitted by four ,low
windows on its south side. Tha entrance door was square headed, and ohamfered on
its outer edge. On its right was a large arehed fireplace, with eorbelled jambs and a
raised stone fenden, and at its sides large aumbry. At the west end, under the day
stair to the dormitory, is a large square opening, too low seemingly for a pulpit, but
possibly a deeply recessed seat, from which the ordinary portion of Holy Writ or other
sacred book would be read during meals. Close by this 100011 is a service hateh or
door, leading to the buttery. Of this buttery, with the passage adjoining, and the
kitohen and scullery beyond, only the foundations remain; and while digging in this
neighbourhood fragments of earthenware and broken pottery were found

The range 01 buildings forming the west side of the eloister is most probably the
remeius of a former dormitory, that apartment being always found either on the west
or east side of the eloister court. Mr. Fergusson wrote about this building as follows:
“It appears to me that what you have found on the west side of the eloister at Cros-
111101111010111111010111100111101111011011011. It seems that 11 some period 01 the
Abbey's history it was found expedient to contraot tho building, and all the acoem-
modation for the monks was eoneentrated at the east and south sides of the eloister.
Under these circumstances the old dormitory was abandoned, 11 notpulled down.” This
chamber, as it now stands, measures 56 1001 2 1101101 by 18 feet 3 inehes. A round-
headed door or window opens to the eloister near its north end; and in its 11011 wall,
