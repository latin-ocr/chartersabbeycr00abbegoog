PLATE ili.

ΟΝ this plate is shown a longitudinal section of the churoh, taken through the nave
and choir. Το avoid repetition, the remarks accompanying Platea ΙΙ. and III. may
bc taken as also applying in part to this Plate; which again, in its turn, may help to
further assist and illustrate those descriptione. It may be here noted that the nave
floor slopcs somewhat downward towards the cheir. To the right of the entrance
door is shown the hollow of the holy water basin. The wall directly under the little
window above Lady Row's tomb was repaircd some years ago, and any indication of
the original work at the back of the tomb isnow lost. On either side, however, of
the window‚ there arc parta of two attached wall shafts, and between their bases is a ⁸
fragment of anarrow hand or sciere, of a distinotly classic character, and a sketoh of
this fragment is given on Plate XVII. Inside the choir, and immediately within the
line of the present belfry gable‚ may be seen the ragged well indicating the position
of thc previous gahle; and against the rough remains of which, the moulded corbel
atring carried along the entire choir, and returned round its window arches, is stopped.
At the sanctuary the triplet wall shafts are carried down to the floor level, where they
are finished with bases. The three platforms are also shown, together with, on the
upper platform, the position of the high altar, dctached from the wall.
