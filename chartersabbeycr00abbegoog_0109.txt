PLATE I.

Tuis drawing is enlarged from the Ordnance Survey 61 1869, 666 16 intended 16
show the immediate surroundings 61 166 Abboy. It indicates the relative positions of
the former and present highway roads, the general lineos 166 boundary wall (66166, 61
least, as these 666 shown in 616 prints and drawings), the Abbey mill, stream, 666 fish
ponds. The old road has been out 61 666 166 over eighty years, 666 16 now overgrown
with grass, 66616 parts under cultivation. In Slezer’s view, in 16961166 boundary
walls are shown enclosinga considerable extent 61 ground, and, with the entrance gate-
way, were then strong and in good preservation. They continued to be so till 61 least
1762, when Clerk made his picturasque little etching, in which, however, the walls
are shown as being much higher, and even strongly fortified, the gateway itself being
protected by two strong towers. That the boundary walls were strong 666 high is
confirmed by two pencil sketches, shown 16 me only a few weeks ago, by the 1616 Μ6.

boundary wall 16 shown to have been over 10 1661 high. The Abbey mill appears 16
have been situated without the boundary walls, and its wheel gable was standing in
the beginning 61 166 present century. Grose shows it in his view from the north,
lying 16 166 west 61 166 Ahbey, 666 116 6116 was pointed out to me by the 616 166661

Plate. The stream, now very 666611, 666, 61666 166 opening 61 another channal 16 166
Abbey mills, 61 little importance, formerly flowed past the Abbey, somewhat to the
south 61 116 present course. Clark shows it passing clear 61 166 Abbey walls3 while 16
Slezer‘s view it is not shown at all, and 16 presumably hidden by the rising ground in
his foreground. The present bank 61 earth, reaching to the southwell 61 1166 Abbct's
tower, covers partos 166 616 61666661 61 166 stream, as well 66 the only existing portion
61 the boundary wall, which here springs from the south 61 166 166666.
