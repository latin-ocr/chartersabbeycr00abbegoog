PLATE XXIX.

Tus masons’ marks at Orosraguel are very numerous, and full of interest. A careful
rubbing has been taken from each of the different marks it was possible to distinguish ;
these rnhbings have been arranged into groups‚ lettered and tabulated, and reduced to
their present size by photclithography. On the work of the original Abhey no
masons' marks could he found, hut it is only right tc say that these early portione ara
either so ruinous and decayed, or so thickly covered with lichen, that the search for
masons’ marks was from the beginning almost hopeless. On the library‚ scriptorium,
gale tower, and doveaot, they do not appear to have ever existed 3 while, on the rc-
maining stones of the door from the cloister to tho dormitory day stair, one indistinct
markis found several times repeated.

The masons' marks shown on tha accompanying Plate may be divided into the
following five groups :—

1. The present nave.
2. The remaining portion of the early choir and chapter-house wall.
3. The later portions of the present choir.

4. The sacristy and chaptenhouse.
5. The Abhot's tower.

Nc. 1. The present nave.

A. Eight of this mark on the window next the north door, and many of the
same on the nave walls.

B. Many of this mark on the walls.

Ο. Only one of this

D. About six of this.

E. This man appears to have cut most of the north door, also the hawn work
of the door to the cloister. ⁴

F. This mark is near the north door, and is much worn.

G. Only one of this, and it is indistinct.

H. This mark is from Lady Row’s tomb.

I. This mark was found on a fragment of the original base, dug up near the
sacristy.
