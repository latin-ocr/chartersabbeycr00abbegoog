ΤΗΕ Cluniae arrangement of monastic buildings, while following generally that of
the Benedictine model, differed from it in its greater irregularity of plan At Oros-
raguel, however, the grouping is simple and convenient; and, although built at various
periodo and with frequent alteration, it still retains to a very great extent most of the
usual features of an ordinary monastic establishment. There are the three typical
divisione: the church the cloister, and the domestic buildings. Lying almost due east
and west is the first group, comprising the nave and ohoir. On its south side is the
cloister gartb, round which are the usual claustral buildings To the east ol this court
is that of the infirmary, near at handis the Abbot's tower, and probably beyond to the
east the cemetery. The domestic buildings were in their usual position to the west,
and occupied two sides of the outer or base court The court or close of the choreb,
which was open to the public, lay to the north, within the bound-ary walls At sonte
distance to the west was the Abbey mill; and, usually to the extreme south, the orchards
and gardana.

Taking then, the first group, and entering by the north door (Plate Vll), a rool-
less nave is found, about 78 feet 9 inches long hy 24 feet 8 inches wide. Its north
wall is pierced by five pointed windows of unusual form (Platea lV. Vll. and vlit),
that above Lady Row's tomb being an insertion of the sixteentlr century. ln tlris wall,
close by the entrance door, is a small circular lrollow, indicating the position ol the
holy water basin In the south wall, and nearly opposite to the entrance, is a door
leading to the cloister. It has a semicircular head with a small clrarnfer on its outcr
edge and step. It may be here noted that the moulding of the doorstep is a feature
of frequent occurrence throughout the Abbey. High up iu this wall, above the line of
the cloister roof, and overlooking the cloister gartlr, are porticus of two small attic
windows one being now completely built up. The remeius of the west gable show a
confused intermingling of old and modern work. Bloclrs of the original aslrlar wrall
are here and there visible; while low down, and almost covered with rubbislr, is a
fragment of the early west door of the church. A lew stones only of one jarnb are
left, and a detail of this is given in Plate XXV, Nc. ln. At the east end, and entirely
shutting out the view of the choir, is the late fifteenth century gable. l’assing through
the small door in this gable the choir is entered. It is a long, apsidal and sornewlrat
ornate building‚ of early filteenth century worknranslrip3 rootless, like the nare, and
