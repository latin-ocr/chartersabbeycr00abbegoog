84 REMARKS ΟΝ ΤΗΕ EXISTING BUILDINGS

Probably the only portion of the original Abbey now remaining above
ground is part of the ruined west gable of the nave, more immediately
round its rude and now built-up door, the two fragments os buttresses at

 

its north-west corner, and a small corresponding portion of the south wall.
It is just possible that this entire wall, as far as the belfry gamag may
belong to this early period; but of this one cannot be certain, and the
balance of facts strongly inclines towards a later date—the period of the
rebuilding of the present north wall of the nave.²

Underground, where this north wall of the nave is.built, are the founda-
tions of the original nave wall, showing returns for buttresseS, with a con-
tinuous double-splayed base, and boldly moulded roll above.³ This base
course is carried round the north transept‚ the foundations of which are
almost entire, and of which the west wall, at least, has been apparently
without buttresses. Deep down on the south side of the nave are the

foundations of· the east wall of another transept‚ corresponding in length
and position with that on the north.
