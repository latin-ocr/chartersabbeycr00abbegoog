PLATE XIX.

Tnnun of the four remaining doors in the cloister are shown on this Plote, and of
these that of the chapter-houseis the most importent. The moulded jumbs (Plete
XXVII„ No. 2) of this door heve been finished at their lower ends with bases, the
detail of which is now very uncertain. The unequcl mitering et the epex of the eroh
is the result of careless workmanship, end the finish of the arch mould on either side
is, in consequence, of slightly different sine end contour; the lower ends of the hood
mould are cut square, like those of the prooessionol door from the ohoir, shown on this
Plote, and a similer finish is found on the door in the belhy geble The processione]
door hes been moulded on its outer jemb (Plete XXVL, No. 19) and inner arris, the

former moulding terminating upon e moulded base, now almost entirely worn away.
This is the door already spoken of es an insertion in the existing well of the former
ohoir, end the muson’s mark found on three of the stenes of this door, is the same as
the one mark peculier to the early fifteenth century portion of the ohoir es it now
existe The little round-headed door, the last shown on this sheet‚ leeds to the
cellnrers passage, and is probably of a slightly later date then either of the two doors
described above.
