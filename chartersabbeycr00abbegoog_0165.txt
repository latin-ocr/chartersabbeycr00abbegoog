PLATES X. aun XI.

Tua belfry or bell turret is of simple design, and is pierced with openings for two
bells; above these openings is a moulded string (Plate XXV, No. 14), which also
divides them from the gablet above3 and crowning all is the very quaint and
beautiful cross, the ingathcring to which is most satisfactorily arranged Thebans,
which used “to summan the clergy and faithful to the service of God,” are lost, and
not even a tradition of their fate remains. All one can gether is that, during drainage
operation some years age, one of the workmen found near the dovecot what he thought
was a picae of gold, “as big as his hand‚'' but which, on the authority of an Ayr
jeweller, turned out to be a piece of bell-meta13 possibly a fragment of one cf the
Abbcy bells.

The drawings on Plate XI. give a fair idea of the crass, and the division of the ten
hearts on the two sides into two groups of four and six, facing respectively thc east
and west, is worthyof consideration. When Sir J ames Fergusson had this gable pointed
a few years ago, the stonework under the cross was found to be almost entirely worn
away, while the cross itselfoscillated attha gentle touch of a finger ; and there is little
doubt that, but for the care it thcn received, it would now have been among the things
of the past, for the next severe gale would assuredly have thrown it down.
