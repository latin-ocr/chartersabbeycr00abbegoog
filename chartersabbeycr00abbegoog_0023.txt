King¹ of thc countrie, apprehendit the said Maistcr Allane, and carried him
to the hous of Dunura where 101 11111011 he was honorablie entreatit.
But efter that certain dayis were spent, and that the Erll culd not obtene
1111 111111 01 Oroceraguall according to his awin appetit, hc determined to
prove gif a collatione could work that which neather dinnor nor supper
could doe 01 1 long tyme. Δ1111101111 said Mr. was caried to a secrcat
chalmer, and hir passed 1111 honorable Erll, his worschipful brother, and sic
11 was appointit to be 1111111111 11 that banquett. ln the chalmcr there
was a gritt 1101 chimlay, under it a syre, other gritt provisione was not
scen. The first cours was ‘My Lord Ahbot’ (said the Erll) ‘it will pleis
you 0011111 heir, that with your awin consent yc remane in my company,
becaus ye deire not comitt you to the handis 01 utheris.’ The Abbote an·

swerit, ‘Wald ye, my lord, that Ι shuld mal< a manifest lcising for your
pleasourl The truth is, my lord, it is against my will that Ι am heir:
neither yit havc Ι ony pleasour in your company.' ‘Bot ye sall remane
with me at this tyme,' said the Erll. ‘I am not able to resist your will
and plcasour,' said 1111 Abbote, ‘in this place' ‘Ye 11111 then obey me,’
said the Erll. And with that were presentit unto him certain letters to
subscryvc, amonges which ther was a lyve year Tak and a 19 year Tak and

a chartour 01 Few 01 111 the landis of Croceraguall, with all the claussis
necessairc for the Erll to hunt him to hell. For gif adulteria, sacriledge,
oppresione, barbarous croweltie, and 111111 hcaped upon thift diserve hell,
the great King of Carrick can 10 morc eschape hell for 1111 101 the im-
prudent Abbote eschaped the syre for a cessone, 11 follows. Eftcr that the
Erll espyed repugnance, and that he culd not comc to his purpose he fair
meanis, hc commandit his cookis 10 prepare the banquett. And so, first,
. they fleeced the scheip, that 11, they took off the Abbotis cleathis ewin to
his skyn3 and nixt they band him 10 the chimlay, his leggia to the one end
and his armis to thc uther; and so they began to hait the tyre, sometimes
to his buttockis, sometymes to his legis, sometymes to his schulders and
armes. And that the rost suld not burne, but that it mycht rost in eoppa,
they spared not flambing with oyle (Lord luik thou to sic 0111111111 l) And
that the crying 01 the miserable man suld not be heard, they closed his

“ King ol Carrick” in consequence 01 the bound· putto 31111 expense ar heritablc bailia 01 the
less jurisdiction which he exercised aa heritable Abbscy‚ therefore Allan Stewart assigna to him
