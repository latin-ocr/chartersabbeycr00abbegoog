ohoir and nave, during the building 01 the present gable‚ would have bean left quite
open, and exposed to tha risk 01 sericus damage from wind and rain. In the centra
01 tha belhy gable is a small door of good form, and cn the nave side 10 0 plain flat
archad receas. Aeross the end 01 the nave there appears to have been a narrow gal·
lery 01 rood loft, entered by a small moulded door opening from the spiral stair from
the ohoir ; and this stair is continued 0 few steps higher, till it again opens into the
ohoir. Although only a few indicatione 01 this gallery 010 1011 on the walls, its exist-
ence cannot be doubted ; aud, among other purposes it may have been used for reading
the (lrospels² letters of communion to the laoy, preaehing‚ and in later times 101 the
service 01 music. On the top 01 this gable is the belfry (Plate X.), with openings for
two bells, surmcunted by a very beautiful cross (Platc XL), with 0 group 01 hearts
round a centra 01 the intersection 01 the arms. The sacristyis a large apartment,
with 0 good light, and a vaulted oeiling 01 great elegance and beauty, the moulded
ribs 01 which 010 carried by very quaint and curious corbels ; and near the floor level
a stone bench or seat occupies three 01 110 sides This chamber is usually found near
tha ohoir or transept, and was used by the olergy 101 the purpose 01 robing and 101

Entering the eloister, 110 four walks 01 alleys ean still be 1100011. These alleys
were probably enclosed on their inner sides by a wooden screeu, glazed or open, aud
stiffaned at intervals by strong upright posta, supporting a shed or lean-to 1001, cover·

clustered pillar of stone; and in the two cornera 01 the west alley are single corbels,
ona of which still carries 0 1010101100 01 0 broad ohamfered rib, which has reached

diagonally 10 these angle plera. Tha corbels (Plate XXVII.‚ No. 14), carrying the
horizontal wall bearn of the lean-to 1001, yet remain in considerable numbers ; those

on the east wall being the most numerous, and the four next the choir have oarved
faces. In the ohurch wall 01 the north alley are the two processional doors, used in
