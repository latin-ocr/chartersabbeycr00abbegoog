PLATE XIV.

Tms quaint little door is illustrated by a plan and elevatior, and, to 1 larger scale, the
detail 11 1 jamb and base. The jamb mould (1111 shown on Plate XXV1.,N0.2o)is
hold and good, and the base (Plato XXVI„ No. 21), while peculiar, is 11 a very
pleasing forrn The little quirk 011 its lower swelling is repeated on every base
throughout the ohoir, and its general detail is taken from that 11 the wall base in the

earlier chapter-house (Plato XXVI„ 11122). In the base 11 this door the roll fillet
11 the jamb reappears under the octagonal neoking, and the baso itself assumes on
plan this octagonal form, and its lower members 111 etopped against the fillet, which
grows gradually heavier‚ and is continued down to the floor level, projecting at the
same time beyond the 1111 11 the step. Το the right 11 this door one 11 the lower
wall stones is checked out to form also part of 1111 stone paving 11 the floor, and this
line gives the correct floor level On the 111111 the step 11 the lower plotium, with
111 moulded nosing. Just inside this door the lower 11 the two steps in the sacristy
passage is sufficiently hollowed on its outer 1111 to allow the door to swing open past
it, and the 1111 wall is ohecked out about two inehes‚ the thickness 11 the door lisois,
so that when open it might he fiush with the line 11 the passage wall, and thus not
in any way further reduce the already contracted space Τ111 ourious jointing 11 the
stonework in 1111 wall round the door should he noted.
