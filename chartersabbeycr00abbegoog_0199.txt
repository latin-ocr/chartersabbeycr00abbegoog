PLATE XVIII.

ΟΝ this drawingis shown, to a large scale, the south bey of the chapter-house and
librery. The window rybat, arch, end hood mould, with its carved end and apex, are
·fairly entire, and sufficient of the traeery remains to indicate its general design3 and
it is worth noting that its largest stone, with a considerable leverage of dead wei ght,
is held in position by a single joint, and that apparently of little strength. The oarving
on the hood mould isvery original, the two lower terminals being grotesque representa·
tions of the human figure, while the sarving at the apex is so indefinite that its form
only ean he outlined. The hood moulds of the other two similar windows have be'en
omamented with like sarving, rude and quaint3 the termInal at the north side of the
sacristy window, and shown on the preceding Flete, being peculiarly characteristic.
Above the chapter-house window one of the small east windows of the library is shown,
and it is moulded in the same manner as that overlooking the oloister garth (Plato XX.)
The section shows the side view of one of the buttresses the ingoing of the chapter-
house and library windows, the line of the library floor, and the top of the stone seat
round the chapter-house. The plan gives the figured sizes of the chapter-house
window and adjoining buttress, and a detail of the rybat and hood nrould of the

former is shown on Plate XXVII, No. 1.
