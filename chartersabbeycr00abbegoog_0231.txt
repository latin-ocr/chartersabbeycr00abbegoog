PLATE XXV.

Tua detail meuldings shown on thia and the two following Plates have all been very
earet'ully taken from the Abhey buildings; first by exact measurement, where the
forms were equare or reetangular, and the eurved lines afterwards filled in from im-
proeeiona taken by lead wire. They were all drawn out full size on the spot, and
afterwards reduced by pholo-lithography to the present size, so thet the forms now
given are absolutely eorreet reproduetions to a smaller scale of the various mouldings.
Many of the earved lines do not follow true eireles, and seem to have been either

drawn by the hand orto be the result of imperfect workmanship.
