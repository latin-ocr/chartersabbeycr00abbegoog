within a few feet of the same siae. Three broad platforms, each having a single
moulded step, lead up to the high altar, which has been detached from the wall; and
at its side is the moulded jamb (Plate XXVI, N 0. 8) of a narrow door leading to the
space behind. The head of this door has been square. In the north wall, about nine

feet above the floor level, are five pointed windows of varying siae, and wider than .

those in the nave. Tha apsidal windows, now completely ruined‚ have been filled with
rich tracery; and under the window in the south angle is the piscina (Plate XIII),
while immediately adjoining, but in the south wall, and under one of Its two windows,
is tha elaborately carved sedilia Towards the nave, in this wall, is the quaint little
door (Plato XIV.) leading to the sacristy lobby and staircase3 while just beyond are
portions of the chamfered altar platform, built in honour of King Robert the Third in
1404. Naar the belfry gable is the processional door (Plato XIX.) leading to the
cloister, arrd close beside it the niche of another holy water basin (Plato XII.), more
ornamental than that in the nava.

This choir,as already stated, was probably built very early iu the fifteenth century, and
the foundations of the former transepts‚ said to have been then destroyed, are indicated
on the drawings by hatched lines. That portion of the choir wall, however, which now
forms the north wall of the present sacristy, and is continued to its junctior with the
nave wall naar the belfry gable, is part of tha earlier chapter-house and choir; and
from it the present choir has been designed. This wall is shown on Plates III. XV.
and XVI. Its architectural detail will be found to be almost identical with that of
the choir, while the stonework of the two portioris is distinctly different. The masons’
marks can also be divided into two distinct groups. On tha choir sida of this wall the
three original arches of the blind arcade ara slightly stilted at the top, and are flatter
than those copied from them, and continued round the choir. The six triplet wall
shafts round the sanctuary are cmried down to the floor, where they are finished with
very beautiful basea; while the other shafts are stopped against a horizontal string
course returned round them at the level of the window eills, and under each of these
shafts is a large flat stone, now hewn even with the wall The processional door,
although of the same date as the choir,is an insertion in the older wall. The choir
door, like that of the nave, has been pavad with stone, the remaining blocks of which
are shown on Plate III. The choir roof was considerably higher than that of the nave,
and both have been of wood covered with slates; the corbel stones for tha support of
the roof beams, and tha atone weatharing above, being still discernible on thc belfry
gable. The very curicus position of this gable, blooking up the antire half of one of
the nave windows, may be accounted for hythe theory that the previous gable was
left ia sita till the present gable was built. Τὴθ overlapping of the nava wall on the
north side by that of the choir, and the rough walling there remaining, indicate the
position of the earlier gabla; and the theory that tha one gable was built previous to
the removal of the other, thus necessitating its unfortunate position, is reasonable, if
one considers that, had the earlier gable first been removed, tha inner ends of both
