PLATE V.

Tffls plate shows the Abbey buildings in their present condition, as seen from the
cast. The former richness of the choir apsa is now represented by a single window
arch, the tracery of which is entirely destroyed, but some idea of its former character
may be gathared from the remaining ryhats‚ and a fragment of tracery, now placed for
greater security in the sacristy. Tha buttressad wall to the south of the choir is fairly
entire, and the tracery ot the windows in the chapter-house and sacristy could easily
be restored from the existing fragments. Above the two windows of the chapter-house
are those of the library, and in the angle next the choir tha remains of the ruined
night stair may still be seen. Το the left of this group is the borrel vault of the

parlour roof, and immediately adjoiningis the flat pointed arch of tha slype‚ the stone
· seats on either side of which are also shown. Closs by is the dungeon window; and
in the left angle ol the court, is, in a single stone, one half of the door arch of the
crosa passage. A section is given of the vaulted cellars forming the south side of the
infirmary court and these cellans seem to have been at a lower level than the other
buildings. Behind, and above all, is the lofty outline of the gata tower.
