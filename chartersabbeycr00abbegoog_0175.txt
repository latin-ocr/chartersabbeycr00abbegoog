PLATE XIII.

Possunt the most elaborately carved stonework in the Abbey buildings has been that
61 the piscina and sedilia, drawings of which are given on this Plato. Unlortunately
much 61 the delicate carving has been wantonly destroyed, and what is yet lest has
suffered much from the hand 61 time. The piscina shows the remains of 6 flat arched
niche, enclosing two shallow basins, the outlet ohannels 116111 which are at the back
The jamb mouldings are finished against bases (Plate XXVI, No. 14) resting upon 6

boldly moulded sole (Plato XXVI, No. 13). On each of the outcr sides of these
moulded jamhs there have been small bnttresses, finished at the top with 6 long pin·
naclc, The gablet is egee in shapc, enelosing a circle with quatrefoil and eerved
spandrils‚ and the hood mould hasbeen ornamented with crockets and a carved finial,
now destroyed The 66111116 shows an arcade 61 four compartments‚ with small moulded
ribs 611 the under side of its coved canopy, and this portion of the work shows traces
of dull red colouring. The outer 1666 is represented by four elaborately eervsd gablets,
with groups 61 carved pinnacles between. Esch gahlet has enclosed a quatreloil in a
circle, and surmounts a cusped arch, the eusping, however, being now entirely destroyed
The carved bosses at the lower extremities 61 the gablcts and pinnacles are now merely
rough messes of stone. The gablets have each had four carved crookets on either side,
and on top 6 carved finini, the general form 61 which is hest shown on the right hand
gablet These fininls, and those 61 the pinnacles, have been carried above the moulded
string 61 the choir. Details 61 the side jambs with their bases, and the neoking at the
back 61 the sedilia, are shown on Plate XXVI, Nos. 9, 11, and 10. The face 61 the
stone seat is quite broken ewey, but sufficient remains to show fragments of a carved
head at either end For convenIence of representation the piscina and sedilia are on
this drawing shown on the same wall plane; the correct angle io, however, shown on
Plate 111, at the choir apse. The broken and erumbIIng stonework 61 the two draw-
ings is shown as it actually existe.
