PLATE XX.

ΟΝ this Plato is shown part of the east wall of the oloister, with the little librery
window overlooking the garth. The window itself is very simple end effective, and
eonfraats pleasantly with the plain mass of masonry eround Immediately under it
ere two of the oorbels for the support of the former wall beam of the east alley roos,

and the water table above is quite fresh, and almost wholly entire. The plan shows

’ the usual stone window seatS, and the corbeis in the wall above indicate the line of
the oeiling bearn. The ourious stone fillet on the ineide of the mullion and transom
is peculim, and on the exterior the deep hollow moulding is very satisfaotory. These
moulded stones are detailed on Plate XXV11.,N0s. 13, 14,and 15. The library, and
tho saeristy adjoining, are later in date than the chapter-house and sacristy above which
they ore built, and the junctior line of the two portions ean be easily followed on the
east and west walls. On the latter well tho four corbolo next the ehoir ere much
weatherwom‚ and bear traces of earving similar in style to that found in the saeristy,
and these eorbels are earlier than those remaining to the westward, which ere quite
plain, and of the same date as the upper rooms.
