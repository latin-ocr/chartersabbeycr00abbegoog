foundations exist underground oi a small ohamber 11 ite south end. The new dormi·
tory lay above the buildings south 11 the chapter-house, and probably also over the
refectory, but scarcely a fragment 11 these upper walls now remains. The dormitory
day stair from the cloister was at the side of the refectory door, and 11111 stair must
have had one or more of its lower steps projecting into the cloister alley; the door
jamb was moulded (Plate XXVII, No. 17), 111 111 head circulor. Besides this day
stair, the dormitory had always direct communication with the ehurch; at Crosraguel,
through 1 1111 into the library, and thence through the scriptorium to the night 11111,
leading down 11 the sacristy and choir. The library and scriptorium (Plate Ill.) are
respectively above the chapter-house and sacristy, and were built sometime after the
completion of the lower rooms In the library there is a large fireplaoc with moulded
jambs‚ a stone hearth, and fender fillet; also three windows, that overlooking the

above the library door ; it has no fireplace, and but one small window, similar 11 those
in the east wall 11 the library. Α separate passage, entered from the south-east angle

are now completely ruined3 even the foundations are hardly traceable, and one can
be certain of little more than the carved club skew and the few remaining corner

The Abbot’s tower is, unfortunately, much destroyed, one angle and 1 large portion
oi the corresponding side walls having been uudermined and cast down by the stream.
The entrance door must have been near this angle, and there is yet lel't part 11 the
passage from it to the circulor stair leading to tlie principal floor above; ona side of

Abbot's hall 1111 the Abbey buildings are yet, however, sair-ly 111111. The inaeons’
marks on this tower correspond with those of various portions throughout the clrnrch

Plate Il. are most likely those 11 the buildings which always found a place 11111 the
