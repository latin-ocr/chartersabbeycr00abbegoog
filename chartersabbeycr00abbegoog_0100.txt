AT CROSRAGUEL ABBEY. 83

drawings, a glauce at these platos, together with a brief outline 01 the

general appearance and surroundings 01 the building, may enable us
better 10 understand the history of its ruin.

The Abbey is situatcd iu a quiet 11011011, about two miles south 01
Maybole‚ on the present Girvan read. lt lies about forty yards from the
wayside, divided from it only hythe old aud now disused graveyard. Secu
from the road, few 01 110 11000 break the mouotony of 1110 000110, aud the
near view of the eold sunless uorth frout presente 011 appearance at once
misleading and disappoiutiug, aud the wonder seems to be that auy build-
iug, more especially au abbey, should ever have been placed iu such a
situation. This first impression, however, is unfair to the Abbey3 for the

ι old highway formerly skirted the rising ground to 1110 uorth; aud seen

from this road, as oue breasted the orest of the hill above, from 0 001111 01
view much more advantageous than the present, the prospect must have
,been charmiug. Let auy oue, desirous to realise what the old place was iu
a bygoue day, rise to this point, aud imagine 101 himself the Abbey, with
its many roofs and gables, uestliug peacefully iu the hollow at tho bottom
of the hill, surrouuded by its strong boundary walls, its wood aud sparkliug
streamlet, its mill, its orchards aud gardeus, its grain lauds aud pasture
lauds, and beyond, the vast stretohes of 111001 and forest joining hands with

the purple hills, far away past the end of the broad valley aud the dark

rugged hill of Killdoou.

“ Auou from the belfry
Softly the Angelus sounded, and 0101 the 10010
columns of pale blue 01110110, like clouds of incense ascendiug.'’

' Crosraguel has had its sceues 01 0101111 as well 00 suushiue; 101 although
all positive written record 01 destruction has perished, exceptiug that
beginning 01 the eud in the days 01 John Kuox,1we have 1110 negative
statement, from the original documents uow published, that at sundry
times it 1100 been “repaired’' aud restored after having suffered from the
“savage fury 01 1100110111100.”2 These experientes, aud the troublous times
iu which it lived, douhtless iu part account for its strong towers of defeuee;
101 Orosraguel takes rauk with St. Andrews, Aberbrothic, aud many others,
as oue 01 the fortified abbeys of Scotlaud. Here the sword and Bible seem
strangely familiar, aud church aud tower go haud iu haud.
