AT CROSRAGUEL ABBEY. 85

Thus we have 101 110 original Abbey an aisleless nave over 1201001
long, by 24 1001 6 inches wide; transepts 01 110 same width, and about
30 feet long; and a choir, the length and eastern termination of which we
can now only guess.

It is at first somewhat difficult, from the uncertain character 01 110
architectura and building, to say when the north and south walls 01 110
present nave were rebuilt. 11 10 very probable, as in the case 01 01101
Scotch Abbeys‚ that Orosraguel suffered during the Wars 01 Indepcndence3
one Henry de Percy having commanded a portion 01 110 English army at
Orosraguel and Turnberry in 1306 and 1307.¹ It is during this period that
the north and southwelle 01 110 original nave may have been destroyed,
and serious damage done to the Abbey generally. In 1324 and twice
in 1328 King Robert the First gifted certain lands to the Abbot and
monks 01 Orosraguel ;² and in 1329, 0 year 01101110 independence 01
Scotland had been acknowledged by the English parliament, the Abbot
received the King's penny 101110 repair 01 110 Monastery.⁸ The architec-
ture 01 110 present north wall* is 01 about this date. 11 10 0100 more than .
likely that the south wall, being the inncr· one, may have been rebuilt at
this time with the material 01110 0011101 building-hence its more irregular
masonry. The long chamber forming the west side 01 110 01010101 00011
10 built against this wall-not bonded into it-but 110 walling isvery
similar in character, and may be 01 110 same or 0 slightly later date. About
this time may also have been erected part 01 110 present Abbot's tower;
probably too, the range 01 vaulted cellans on the· south side 01 110 infirmary
court, and above which would be the Abbot’s hall, connected with the
tower‚ and raised 0 few steps above the level 01 110 first floor.

11011001,Β writing 01 Orosraguel, says, “ In the beginning 01 the fifteenth
century 110 choir was rebuilt and the north wing 01 110 transept wholly
removed, wbilst the south arm was converted into a square chapter-house
with a central pillar and a' library over it.” This conjecture 10 101 the
most part probably 0011001. The excavations prove the existence 01 110
earlier north and south transepts, while the position 01 110 three fragmentary
010110 and bases, in what is now the wall 01 110 010001110001101)71 and little
stain lobby adjoining,⁷ confirm the statement as to 110 chapter-house. The
only diffcrence being, that the entire thickness 01 1110 wall carrying these
