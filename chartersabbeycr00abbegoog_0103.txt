86 REMARKS ΟΝ THE EXISTING BUILDINGS

> shafts and bases is of earlier dat'e than the rest of the choir; and that, although

the latter agrees in architecture with this wall, it has been modelled from
it, and not built with it. This theory, then, would make the chapter-house1
mentioned by Wallcot earlier than the choir, which may have been, and
probably was, built very early in the fifteenth century; but, judging from
the architecture alone, it has all the appearance of being late fourteenth
century work, and goes far, I think, to-prove that this portion, at least of
the choir wall,2⁴ which also formed the north wall of the old chapter-house,
is of earlier date than the rest of the choir, and that the latter was modelled
from its lines. The architecture of this wall is undoubtedly late fourteenth
century, even allowing for the fact that architectural features took some
time to reach, and to be incorporated 111 the work of, outlying districts such
as Orosraguel.

ln 1404 a special altar was built by King Robert the Third? where one
111555 was to be said daily for the soul of the King and certain others, and
in return for which he granted and confirmed lands· to the Abbey. From
this gift the eost of the new choir may have been in part defrayed. The
platform of this altar was found during the excavations, and I have no
hesitation in saying it was built with, or immediately after, the completion
of the new choir,

Whatever earlier buildings may have previously existed round the east
and south sides of the cloister court, heve been entirely destroyed; and
their site is now occupied by the present sacristy and chapter-house⁴ of
Abbot Colin in 1487.δ Atthis time the Abbey appears to have been in
difficulties; and Abbot Oolin while rebuilding the cloister portion, and pro-
bably repairing the ehurch, seems to have been compelled to reduce its
dimensions. That this was the 555515 apparent from the fact, that the
belfry gable,⁶ which is a distinct insertion, entirely divides the nave from
the choir, so far at least as the purposes of ritual 51 religious ceremony are
concerned. Until this time the churoh had been most likely open from
end to end; but proving too large for the revenue or service of the Abbey,
it was reduced to the limite of the cboir only: the nave being still, however,
roofed over, and forming possibly a large outer vestibule to the 511511. It
was also used as a place of burial, and was called Saint Mary's, 51 the
“ Virgin's Aisle.'' ⁷
