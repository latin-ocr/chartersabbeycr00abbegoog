PLATES XXII. XXIII. arm XXIV.

Trissa three Plutes are principally drawings of the gata tower, which was probably the
last inhabited portion of the Abbey, and even now it only requires a roof and two fioors
to render it again perfectly habitable. These drawings are perhaps also interesting as
showing in details small semi-baronia] building of the sixtecnth century, which is,
so lar at least as the walls are concemcd‚ in almost perfect preservation The entrance
arohwayis vaulted, and in the thickness of the wall on one side is a long narrow
chambcr, with one small wall slit for light. The stair to the uppcr rooms opens from
the courtyard; and near the level of the first fioor is a now huiltup door, leading to
the welk on the top of the battlcmented screen wall, which connects this tower with
the claustral buildings. In one of Mr. Fcrgusson's skctches he shows the corbelling ol
asmall circulor stair in the angle where this wall joins that of these buildings, but
unfortunately this portion of the wall is now a wreck of sallcn masonry; still it is
more than probable that the battlcmented walk terminated at the stair, which would
communicate with the courtyard or one of the cloister buildings. Slezer, however, in
his drawing shows this same battlcmented wall returned along the entire west wall of
the common room, but one cannot be at all certain that the wall head welk was carried
along with it, for the wall is now very ruinous, and there is no trace visible of any
stair or other opening from this wall to the ground or nave. Returning to the tower,
its nppcr floors have been oi wood, and a large fireplace, and two small windows with
stone scats are in each of the two rooms. The stair iscontinued up to the level of the
roof, round which has been a pavcd walk with battlcments, the merlons of which are
now destroycd; and from the stair side of this walk ten little stone steps, five on
either side, lead up to the small square chumber above the circular stair, called the
watchtower.

On Plate XXIV. two plans, an elevation and ascetion, are given oi the dovecot,
the door to which appears to have opened from the wall head ol the domestic buildings
and this wall is shown'by Clerk to have been corbelled on its outcr face, and it may
possibly have had, like the wall from the gate towcr, a passage along the top. In the
dovecot the nests are about 8 inches square, arranged in fourteen rows, with 4inch
stone divisione between, and the entrance for the pigeons is at the top. In the uentre
of the door is a trapdoor or hatch opening to asmall circulor chamher below, about

ssfcct 7 inches in diameter, with three narrow wall slits for light. Grose says, “this
room or ‘circular shaft’ surrounded a well ol excellent water 3 '' the only entrance to
which must have been from the floor of the dovecot above. The two rugged openings
at present existing in its'walls were made some years ago for the passage of a drain,
at which time the workmen were down to a depth of several feet, but no truce of any
well was then found.
