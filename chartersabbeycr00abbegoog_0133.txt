PLATE IV.

Tun north wall oi the church is shown on this Plato es it at present existo, and it may
be divided into three portione, corresponding with the three periods at which it was
built, viz, 1244, 1329, and very early in the fifteenth century. The foundations of
the nave and north transept, the two angle buttresses at the west end of the former,
and the plinth or wall head above, belong to the first period; the nave wall eastward
to the second ; and the entire north wall of the choir to the third In the spleyed bese
near the west end of the nave there have been two breaks or steps, one of which is

still remaining underground, and is shown between the second and third buttresses.
The original plinth has been continued to, and stopped against, the third buttress,
¹ which hus been carried higher than the others, and hasbeen built, together with that
on its right, upon the foundations of two of the original buttresses, while the remaining
nave buttresses eastward have been spaced afresb, arid built independently of the

former inundatione. The nave plinth of the second period (it is almost a cornice) was
carried to, and is in position above, the eestmost buttress of the nave, and its overlap-
piug by the choir plinth aud wall under is interesting, as affording proof of the position
of tbe previous belfry gabis, showing that when the ohoir was built it was joined to
the nave et the east side of this buttress‚ behind which was the gable3 and that when
the present gable was built oo its west side, the portion of the cheir wall above or
overlapping the nave was carried westward with it, while the nave plinth and buttrese
were left in position.
